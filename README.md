# PUG Compiler for the AALeC

## The AALeC

This project is build for the [AALeC](https://github.com/informatik-aalen/AALeC-Hardware) and relies on [AALeC-V2](https://github.com/informatik-aalen/AALeC-V2).

## Using this project

### Arduino IDE

1. Download the code as a ZIP file ([see how](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/downloading-source-code-archives)).
2. Add the ZIP file to your Arduino IDE ([see how](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/5145457742236-Add-libraries-to-Arduino-IDE#importing-a-.zip-library)).

### PlatformIO

1. Add `lib_deps = https://github.com/FX-6/AALeC-pug` to your `platformio.ini` file.

### Conditional Expressions

Conditional Expressions can have one of the following formats:
- `<key>`, evaluates to `true` if the key is any number not 0
- `(<key> = <key>)`, ecalutes to `true` if the keys match

Where `<key>` is one of the following:
- `True` (any number not `0`)
- `False` (the number `0`)
- An unsigned 32 bit integer
- A GPIO ID, see below for more info

### GPIO IDs

- `IO_LED` to see if the LED is turned on
- `IO_BUTTON` to see if the button is pressed
- `IO_ROTATE` to get the rotation
- `IO_TEMP` to get the measured temperature
- `IO_HUMIDITY` to get the measured humidity
- `IO_ANALOG` to get the analog rotation
